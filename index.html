    <h4>What is <em>Lorem Ipsum</em>?</h4>
    <p>In layman's terms, <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is a dummy or placeholder <strong>text</strong>. It's often used in laying out print, infographics, or web design. The primary purpose of <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is to create <strong>text</strong> that does not distract from the overall layout and visual hierarchy.</p>
    
    <h4>A Brief History of <em>Lorem Ipsum</em>?</h4>
    <p>The term <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is derived from the Latin term Do <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> which means "pain itself. " The <strong>text</strong> has been in use for a very long time and its history spans for over two millennia. </p>

    <h4>Ancient Roots</h4>
    <p>Its origins were discovered by Richard McClintock, a Latin Scholar from Hampden-Sydney College. According to his research, <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> dates back to 45 BC, from Classical Latin literature.</p>

    <p>The words in the <strong>text</strong> originated from the book De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The ends of Good and Evil). The series of books was a treatise on the theory of ethics and was written by the ancient Roman philosopher and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero.</p>

    <p>The placeholder <strong>text</strong> was taken from the first book's discourse on hedonism. Its original <strong>text</strong> is a lot more cohesive than the modern version. The treatise was very popular during the Renaissance period, and it compelled a great many intellectuals and luminaries of the time to read the books.</p>
